### CO-Founder of Melt DSP

I have more the 10 years of experience in software management and development and over 5 years of experience on AdTech industry. I am passionate with software development and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills. 

My major achievement is that I have created the first Demand-side Platform (DSP) in Brazil. I was the first person to integrate a DSP with Googleâ€™s Doubleclick AdExchange and with Appnexus SSP in Latin America.

These last 5 years building a company from the ground made me grow a lot in terms of technical and people management skills. I have been always present on the daily technical activities acting with many roles like Scrum Master, Team Lead, DevOps and Software Engineering.
